The film depicts the harrowing events of October 3 and 4, 1993, when a group of elite U.S. soldiers from the 75th Ranger Regiment, Delta Force operators, and 160th SOAR pilots were sent to capture two top lieutenants of Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The mission was supposed to take less than an hour, but it turned into a bloody 15-hour ordeal when two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by RPGs and hundreds of Somali militiamen swarmed the crash sites. The U.S. soldiers had to fight their way out of a hostile city with limited ammunition and support, while facing overwhelming odds and casualties.
 
Black Hawk Down is a realistic and intense portrayal of modern warfare that does not shy away from showing the brutality and heroism of both sides. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Sound at the 74th Academy Awards. It also received positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, who praised its direction, cinematography, action sequences, and performances. The film was also criticized for some historical inaccuracies and for depicting the Somalis as one-dimensional villains.
